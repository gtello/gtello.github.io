This is a step-by-step guide presented in a professional report format on a penetration test conducted on a Debian 10 machine called Academy, which in this case was renamed to Monkey.
<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive Summary</h2>
<p>A security analysis was performed on the Monkey machine (Debian 10). Several vulnerabilities were identified, starting with a misconfigured FTP service allowing anonymous login, which facilitated access to critical information, such as credentials and a password hash. Through brute force on web directories and an unrestricted file upload attack, unauthorized access to the server was achieved. Subsequently, access was escalated to an administrator user by modifying a bash script that ran with elevated privileges.</p>
<p>This allowed total control of the server and access to confidential information. Multiple configuration and access control issues were detected that need to be corrected to improve the security of the machine and its services.</p>
<h2 id="reconnaissance">Reconnaissance</h2>
<p>A network scan was conducted using the nmap tool to identify open ports and services on the machine.</p>

<h2 id="exploitation">Exploitation</h2>
<p>The nmap scan showed that the FTP service on port 21 allowed anonymous login, so that was performed.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image2.png" alt="ftp login" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 2:</em> FTP login as anonymous user</center>
<p>An FTP connection was made through the <code>anonymous</code> account, which allowed access to a note left on the server.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image3.png" alt="developer note" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 3:</em> Developer's note</center>
<p>It was observed that the developer left a note on the FTP server mentioning that they had to resort to using a SQL statement to create a new user for the academy’s website. The value in the <code>password</code> field was an MD5 hash, so we proceeded to crack the hash with hashcat.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image4.png" alt="hashcat result 1" />
    <img src="/images/posts/academy/image4_1.png" alt="hashcat result 2" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 4:</em> hashcat result</center>
<p>The hash crack was successful, revealing that the password for the <code>HackerMentor</code> user is <code>junior01</code>. To proceed, the open port 80, suggesting a webpage was serving content from the machine, was analyzed.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image5.png" alt="apache web server" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 5:</em> Apache Web Server service</center>
<p>The default Apache webpage was found, confirming that this machine is hosting a web service. Brute force was performed on web directories.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image6.png" alt="wfuzz" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 6:</em> Brute force on web directories with wfuzz</center>
<p>The web directories <code>/phpmyadmin</code> and <code>/monkey</code> were discovered.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image7.png" alt="academy portal" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 7:</em> Academy login portal</center>
<p>The credentials discovered earlier were used, and login to the Monkey portal was achieved. Detailed inspection of this webpage revealed a student enrollment section allowing image uploads. An attack called <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload">Unrestricted File Upload</a> was attempted to try executing PHP code on the web server and achieve a reverse shell.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image8.png" alt="php code" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 8:</em> PHP code for reverse shell</center>
<p>This .php file was uploaded to the server, and as a test image upload had previously been performed, it was found that images are stored at <code>http://192.168.138.128/monkey/studentphoto/image.jpg</code>. Once the image was uploaded, the code was executed, and a connection with netcat on port 1234 was opened.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image9.png" alt="reverse shell connection" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 9:</em> Reverse shell connection established</center>
<p>The exploit worked correctly, gaining access to the server as user <code>www-data</code>. To escalate privileges, the script <a href="https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS">LINpeas.sh</a> was used. For file transfer to the server, a basic HTTP server was set up with Python using the command <code>python3 -m http.server 80</code> to download the file from the server. The script was run to discover privilege escalation paths with the following findings.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image10.png" alt="mysql password" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 10:</em> Plaintext password of MySQL database</center>
<p>Once the password was found, it was tried in conjunction with the known user on the academy’s web portal to connect to that user via SSH.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image11.png" alt="ssh session" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 11:</em> SSH connection to hackermentor user</center>
<p>A flag and a bash script named <code>backup.sh</code> that backs up the academy&rsquo;s website files were found. The <code>ls -l</code> command shows that this script runs as an administrator user. Checking with <code>crontab</code> and <code>systemd</code>, it was not possible to determine if this script is automated, so <a href="https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy">pspy</a> was used for confirmation. This program monitors Linux processes without needing root permissions.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/images/posts/academy/image12.png" alt="process monitoring" />
</div>
<center><em>Figure 12:</em> Process monitoring with pspy showing script execution</center>
<p>The script was observed running as the root user. Since the <code>hackermentor</code> user has permissions to edit this file, the script was modified to execute a reverse shell, and as it runs as root, root access to the machine was obtained through this.</p>

</table>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>During this security analysis, several critical vulnerabilities were found on the Monkey machine. Initial access was gained through a misconfigured FTP service allowing anonymous logins, which gave access to sensitive files. User credentials were then discovered, allowing access to the web and remote code execution on the server. Lack of restrictions on file uploads and an elevated permissions script without proper protections enabled privilege escalation, leading to root access. The combination of poor permission management, insecure configurations, and the lack of robust authentication controls allowed the system to be fully compromised.</p>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<p>To mitigate these vulnerabilities, anonymous login on the FTP service must be disabled. Ensure passwords are never stored in plaintext and that hashes use stronger algorithms.
Regarding privilege escalation, review and restrict user permissions on critical scripts like <code>backup.sh</code>, preventing non-privileged users from modifying them. It is also recommended to perform continuous system monitoring with tools like pspy to detect anomalous activities in processes.</p>
